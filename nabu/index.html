<h1>Introduction</h1>

The Nabu compiler is a polyglot compiler for compiling source code into Java bytecode
so it can be executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).<br/>
Writing and maintaining a compiler takes a lot of time and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of the Nabu compiler is to make this easier, and you don't have to start from scratch.<br/>
Just provide a language parser which parses the source code and build an AST and the compiler will do the rest.<br/>
<br/>
The compiler is extendable via plugins.
Compiler plugins can provide extensions for things like parsing source code to support programming languages<br/>
so the compiler can compile source code or provide interoperability.<br/>
<br/>
The compiler supports Java interoperability out of the box.<br/>
<br/>
The compiler supports the Nabu programming language out of the box<br/>
which can call/use Java.<br/>
